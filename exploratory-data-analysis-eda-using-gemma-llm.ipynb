patterns and trends:** EDA helps identify patterns and trends in the data, which can be used to make predictions and insights.\n","* **Discover relationships between variables:** EDA can help discover relationships between variables, which can lead to the development of new insights and solutions.\n","* **Clean and prepare data for modeling:** EDA can be used to clean and prepare data for modeling,

decision-making and problem-solving.\n","\n","**Here are some common EDA techniques:**\n","\n","* **Descriptive statistics:** This technique provides summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and frequency distribution.\n","* **Data visualization:** This technique uses visual representations, such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, to explore the data and identify patterns.\n","* **Correlation analysis:** This technique measures the relationship between two variables, and can be used to identify trends and outliers.\n","* **Anomaly detection:** This technique identifies data points that deviate from the norm, which can be used to identify outliers and potential anomalies.\n","\n","**Here are some tips for conducting EDA:**\n","\n","* Start with a clear understanding of the data and the research question.\n","* Choose the right tools and techniques for the data.\n","* Use a systematic approach to data exploration.\n","* Communicate your findings
